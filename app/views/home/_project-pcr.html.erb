I collaborated with five members of the Stanford AI Laboratory to develop a solely machine learning based algorithm to recognize text in photographs.  We designed a three-step algorithm in which the first step detected regions of text in an image.  The second step attempted to recognize letters within the detected region and the third step utilized the letter information to probabilistically infer a word.  The 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and RecognitionInternational Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICDAR) published our paper which is available <a href="http://robotics.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icdar01-TextRecognitionUnsupervisedFeatureLearning.pdf"> here </a>.
